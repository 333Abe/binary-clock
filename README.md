# binary-clock

wanting to use flexbox i thought this idea would make a good first project.
i've organised the blocks into the reasonable size and shape and it works on a good variety of different sizes and shapes of screens

this is also the first time i've tried to connect javascript to an html file, 
and there were a few headaches.
i couldn't get a while loop to run to continually update the background colours of the divs,
so i had to keep reloading the page instead.
This, i think is causing the screen to flash every 4 seconds.

overall pretty pleased with this as it's a project i started myself and didn't follow a tutorial at any point.
