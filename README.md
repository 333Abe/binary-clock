# binary-clock

Wanting to use flexbox, I thought this idea would make a good first project.
I've organised the blocks into the reasonable size and shape and it works on a good variety of different sizes and shapes of screens.

This is also the first time I've tried to connect javascript to an html file, 
and there were a few headaches.
I couldn't get a while loop to run to continually update the background colours of the divs,
so I had to keep reloading the page instead.
This, I think is causing the screen to flash every 4 seconds.

Overall pretty pleased with this as it's a project I started myself and didn't follow a tutorial at any point.
